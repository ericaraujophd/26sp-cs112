# Honesty

Laboratory exercises are to be done in pairs, using pair programming. One copy of the assignment will be submitted for grading. Unless specified otherwise, exams, homework assignments, and projects are to be done individually, and must consist of your own original work.

Submitting another student's work as your own (even with their knowledge) is **academic fraud**; and any detected duplication of work will be dealt with in accordance with Calvin's policies on Academic Honesty. Likewise, giving another person your work which they then submit as their own constitutes academic fraud and may result in a failing grade (F) for both parties.

Feel free to discuss ideas with us or with your classmates, but don’t copy code (i.e., plagiarize). Here are examples of what **plagiarism** looks like:

- You **copy** a program from an online source, change some small things (e.g., variable names, output messages), and submit the code without attribution.
- Your roommate writes some code, which you add to your program. You add documentation that shows you understand their code, but never indicate the source of the code.
- You find an online tutorial that walks you through the construction of a system that you then submit without attribution.
- You use a generative model (e.g., ChatGPT) to produce your code, review it, perhaps edit it a bit, and then submit it without attribution.

**Consider these rules of thumb:**

- If you found it efficient to use copy/paste or use a generative language model to create more than one or two lines of your application, you must document the original source of the code.
- If the moment you figure out how to do something occurs while you are looking at a website or at the output of a generative language model, you should document that website.

Note that these rules of thumb apply to the code supplied in this course’s materials as well.

```{warning}
Our graders will be using a tool called the **Measure of Software Similarity (MOSS)** to check all submissions against all other submissions. If two submissions are found to be significantly similar, we will assume cheating has happened. Note that this software is pretty smart. It knows what computer language it is inspecting and can determine if two submissions are the same except for differences in variable names, e.g.
```

Note that if you and someone else both independently ask ChatGPT or Copilot (or some other LLM) to write code for you, and you both submit it, MOSS will detect it as identical and we will have to assume you cheated.
