**Your grade in this course will be based on:**

| Activity          | Weight | Observation                            |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Daily Quizzes     | 5%     | The lowest 3 quizzes will be dropped.  |
| Labs              | 20%    |                                        |
| Homework projects | 25%    |                                        |
| Tests (4)         | 30%    | The lowest test score will be dropped. |
| Final Exam        | 20%    |                                        |

## Grading and Late Work Policies

1. Each exercise and project will have a **Due date** associated with it. This is the date by which you should submit your work in order to avoid falling behind in the course.
2. Each day that your submission is late, you will be assessed a **penalty of 10%** (unless you use grace days -- see below).
3. Periodically during the course, I will announce (in class or through email) that assignments have been graded.
   1. You will have 7 days from that announcement to check your grades and make appeals for changes.
   2. You may also resubmit your assignment and appeal to have it regraded.
   3. After the 7 days have expired, you cannot ask to have your assignment graded or regraded.
4. Assignments that are turned in very late (i.e., so late that at 10% per day, the assignment would receive a 0) will not be graded.

## Grace Days

You have **8 (eight) Grace Days** available to you during the semester. These grace days may be used to submit an assignment late without penalty. **Grace Days Remaining** can be seen in the Grade Book in Moodle.

Here are some circumstances in which you might use grace days:

1. You are an athlete and you have a very busy week. Use a few grace days to catch up the next week.
2. You become ill (physically or mentally) and cannot do the work on time.
3. You need to go home for an emergency.

**Here is the procedure for using grace days:**

- **DO NOT** email me to tell me you are going to use grace days. I don't need to know this -- there is no action I need to take if you tell me this.
- When your assignment grade comes back and you have lost points due to lateness, **then** send an email to ask for the points to be restored and tell me how many grace days you want to use for that.

## Extenuating Circumstances

If you fall ill (physically or mentally) for an extended period of time, AND you send me documentation from Student Life, Student Health Center, or the Center for Health and Wellness, then, and only then, I will consider allowing you to make up late assignments.

```{warning}
If you begin to skip class repeatedly due to mental health problems, go to the Center for Health and Wellness! **Don't delay!**
```

## Incompletes

An Incomplete (I) grade will be granted only in unusual circumstances, and only if those circumstances have been verified by the Student Life Office. Procrastination does not qualify as an unusual circumstance.

```{attention}
**No work** will be accepted after the last day of classes.
```
